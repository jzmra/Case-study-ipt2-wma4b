	  	<p><h3 class="center">Taylor Alison Swift</h3> 
	  	<h4>born December 13, 1989</h4> 
	  	<p>She is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative songwriting, which often centers around her personal life, has received widespread critical plaudits and media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. Her 2006 eponymous debut studio album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s on the Billboard 200. Its third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), expands on country pop styles and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Buoyed by the success of crossover singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Speak Now (2010), her third studio album, blends country pop with rock sensibility and spawned the top-10 singles "Mine" and "Back to December".

	<div class="itemgrid">
	      <div class="item">
	      	<h4 >Taylor first worked in musical theater</h4>
	      	<p>At the young age of nine, Taylor Swift worked in musical theater. This allowed her to perform in the Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions four different times. It was a great experience for her that helped shape her stage presence.</p></div>
	      <div class="item">
	      	<h4 >She was taught how to play guitar by a computer repairman</h4>
	      	<p>At age twelve, Taylor took guitar lessons from a computer repairman, who also knew a thing or two about songwriting. This was the first step in her musical career.</p></div>
	      <div class="item">
	      	<h4 >She was the youngest country artist to write a #1 song</h4>
	      	<p>Taylor Swift was only 14 years old when she wrote “Our Song.” She played the song at her 9th-grade talent show. It went on to hit #1 on the charts, and the music video was also named Video Of The Year at the 2008 CMT Music Awards.</p></div>
	      <div class="item">
	      	<h4 >She has dated (and broken up with) a lot of famous dudes</h4>
	      	<p>She has dated Harry Styles, Jon Mayor, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Conor Kennedy to name a few. “I Knew You Were Trouble” is reportedly written about Gyllenhall. So boys beware. If the relationship doesn’t end well, she will probably write a breakup song about you.</p></div>
